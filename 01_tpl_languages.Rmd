# Introduction

Toronto has a reputation for multiculturalism and multilingualism, so this report is an exploration of language in Toronto. Specifically, this report combines census data with open data from the Toronto Public Library to discover which branches best serve multilingual communities, and how that maps onto Toronto's language communities.

This report was created as part of the "Introduction to R for Journalists" course, offered by Andrew Tran and the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. As such, this entire report, including text markdown, data analysis, graphing, and mapping, was completed using R. The files can be downloaded from my Github page, and you can run the script to produce the same results. I have included the code I used for each section, with extensive comments explaining what each step does. This is necessary for transparency and reproducibility.

The following maps and graphs combine 2016 Canadian census data with 2017 Toronto Public Library circulation data. In both cases, these are the most recent available data sets. While library data from 2016 exists, I am using the more recent data because this report is meant to inform current policy decisions.

## Note

If you just want the results (graphs, maps, and tabular data) from the following code, just run the script "run_all.R" in the main project directory, and sit back. Let me caution you that one of the census files it will download is ~130 MB zipped, and ~1.3 GB unzipped, though I provide a workaround below using the files packaged with this project.

## Accessibility

Graphs and maps can, depending on the colour schemes their creators chose, be inaccessible to people with different kinds of colour blindness. The maps in this report all use the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/end-of-the-rainbow-new-map-scale-is-more-readable-by-people-who-are-color-blind/?sf195206045=1">Cividis colour palette</a>, which has been scientifically optimised for information preservation across many forms of colour blindness and sightedness. Cividis is available as part of the part of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html">Viridis package</a>.

## Sources

All data used in this report are open and freely available for use, provided that attribution is given. I have relied on federal (Canadian) and municipal (Torontonian) open data sets. Each graph and map lists their sources, and here are all of the sources used in this report:

## Terminology

<em>Catchment population</em>: The population which a particular Toronto Public Library branch aims to serve. It is defined in terms of census tracts, and thus in geographic terms.

<em>Census Tract:</em> One of basic geographic units of the Canadian national census until 2016, when it was aggregated with other units. It originally comprising roughly 5000 people, though that can vary considerably after a tract is formed. By 2016, some census tracts in Toronto are defunct, but they are how the Toronto Public Library tracks the catchment population each branch serves.

<em>Circulation:</em>: The Toronto Public Library's term for the recorded borrowing of materials. This term encompasses all library materials that can be borrowed (e.g. circulating books and DVDs, but not in-library reference works). I believe that if the same book is borrowed three times in 2018, then it counts three times for circulation records. The key issue to note here is that circulation does not equal collections; some materials might be used frequently, while others might be untouched. Circulation also does not record in-library usage, hence some branches (e.g. the almost non-circulating Arthur Conan Doyle collection, which has been excluded from this report), report zero or almost zero circulation.

<em>Multilingual:</em> The Toronto Public Library's designation for any materials (e.g books, DVDs, audiobooks) which are in languages other than English or French.

<em>StatCan:</em> Statistics Canada, the official national source for Canadian statistics, including censuses. This report uses the most recent data set, which is from 2016.

<em>TPL:</em> the Toronto Public Library. They publish most of their data annually, meaning that the most recent data are from 2017, except for materials directly relating to the 2016 Canadian census.

## Language
As this report draws on Canadian and Torontonian data, and discusses language use, it unapologetically uses Canadian English spellings. Sorry, eh?

## Thanks
This report grew out of coursework for the course "Introduction to R for Journalists," offered by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. Many thanks to Andrew Tran, the course instructor, for designing the course, providing considerable feedback, and for suggesting the accessible Cividis colour palette. Thanks also to the course assistant Ryan Sagare. Greg Saulmon, Paula Jennings, Yurii Salikov, and especially Clara Engel provided feedback and suggestions on the graphs and maps in this report, so they all have my gratitude.

I ordered the branches in descending rank of their multilingual circulation, and colour-coded them according to the tier of library. Duplicating the X (actually Y) axis allows for greater readability. Please note that I excluded some of the TPL's circulation services, specifically those that do not correspond to physical library branches, from this graph. (For more information on this issue, see Part 3, below.)

Caveats: While the majority of the Toronto Public Library's circulation data can be mapped, a significant minority refer to branches which serve the entire city (e.g. the Reference Library), to "branches" with multiple and mobile locations (Toronto's bookmobiles), or to services which are location aspecific (e.g. the library hotline, which allows for holds and lending services). These are important parts of Toronto's public library infrastructure that I could not place on a map.

In some places, these results match up with library branch catchment areas that have a high multilingual circulation, though that is not always the case. Note that one tract in the Parkdale neighbourhood (southwestern Toronto) lacks census data, is set to full transparency, and therefore appears pure white.

The above graph lists the library branches in descending order of the difference between the observed multilingual usage (in terms of circulation) and the percentage of the population who do not speak English or French. For the purposes of this graph, I assume that, at the very least, a branch's multilingual use should be the same as, or greater than, the percentage of its catchment population that does not speak English or French.

The branches in the upper half of the graph have a higher multilingual circulation than percent of their catchment population that does not speak English of French. The branches in the middle, such as Hillcrest and Yorkville, have matching percentages, while those in the bottom have lower mutlingual circulation percentages than percent of local population that do not speak English or French.

Some branches, such as Steeles and Goldhawk Park, have a relatively high percentage of multilingual circulation and yet still their multilingual circulation is less than their catchment population's percentage of people who do not speak English or French.

Caveats: Please note that the possibly misleading assumption behind my graph above is that circulation accurately reflects the population a branch serves. We should not assume that all linguistic communities use Toronto's library branches equally. We should also not assume that a branch with a percent of multilingual circulation equal to the percent of non-English, non-French speakers in its catchment areas is meeting the needs of its linguistically diverse population; there are, of course, many people who know two or more languages, wholly or partially, and thus even a branch where everyone in its catchment population can speak English or French might benefit considerably from materials in additional languages. For evidence of Toronto's linguistic pluarlity, see Part 8, the map of Torontonians with first languages other than English and French, below. Additionally, the circulation data do not fully express nuanced yet everyday occurances in Toronto, such as an English Language learner, who might not report on a census that they speak English, borrowing English-language materials from a library in order to learn.  Finally, the caveats about which circulation data are mappable (see Part 3, above) also apply here.

# Part 7: Mapping the gap
Now let us map the difference between the last two maps, showing which regions have the biggest margin (i.e. excess or gap) between the observed multingual usage (in terms of circulation) and the expected minimum multilingual usage (in terms of population who do not speak English or French):

All of the caveats mentioned before apply here, of course. Additionally, note that one tract in the Parkdale neighbourhood (southwestern Toronto) lacks census data, is set to full transparency, and therefore appears white.

# Part 8: Mapping Torontonians whose first language is not English or French
While the above maps and graphs displayed information about only those people who do not speak either English or French, here we will map something a bit more representative of Toronto's multilingual population: the percent of people (by census tract) whose first language is not English or French (but who may or may not speak either or both languages.
```{r map 04, warning=F, message=F}
# Step 8: Mapping anyone in Toronto whose first language is not English or French
ggplot(canada_toronto) + 
  geom_sf(data=tpl_join_pmlc_ct, aes(fill = percent_mother_not_ef), size=.1) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(na.value="transparent", label=percent, option="cividis", direction = -1, name="Percent") + 
  labs(title = "Whose first language is not English or French?", 
       subtitle = "Plotted according to Toronto census tracts", 
       caption = "Sources: opendata.tpl.ca/, open.canada.ca/, and www12.statcan.gc.ca/\nLibrary circulation data from 2017, census data from 2016\nby Nicholas Field (@nk_field)") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  coord_sf(datum = NA)
ggsave("output_data/first_language_map.png", width=20, height=16, units="cm")
```
Some parts of Toronto have 80% of the population knowing a first language other than English or French. Unsurprisingly, these populations are often also areas where libraries have higher levels of people who do not speak either English or French. Happily, these are often also areas that see a high multilingual circulation of library materials. Note that one tract in the Parkdale neighbourhood (southwestern Toronto) lacks census data, is set to full transparency, and therefore appears white.

# Conclusion
Some directions for future research are to target specific languages, such as Chinese, rather than the broad category of multilingual material. While the Canadian census data are granular enough to support this kind of analysis, the TPL data sets used above are not. There are, however, about 2.5-3.0 GB of catalogue data in MARC format that might provide more detailed information, provided there is a way of converting them into an R-compatible format.
